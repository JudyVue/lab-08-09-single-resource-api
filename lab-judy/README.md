Single Resource API - Day 8 Lab

This project enables a user to get, post, and delete data passed in to the server.

The data takes the form of an object:

{name: <name>, age: <age>}

Firstly, the user should install http pie onto their machine for optimal use.

The user should start their server on Port 3000 by typing "node index.js" in their terminal.

In a new tab, the user should type http :3000/api/person
